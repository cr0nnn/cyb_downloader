cyb_downloader.py
===================
Just an easy script to download cybrary videos for offline viewing. I don't know if I would improve it to allow downloading all content from a course or all course materials.

Run
-----

I have only used a non standard library, requests, that you can download by issuing:

pip install requests

You can also run it in a [virtualized enviroment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

Feel free to modify my script to allow more interesting features...
